# 👋 Hey, I'm Martin

🎓 CS student at AUB • 🧠 Applied Machine Learning & Personal Analytics  
💼 Currently interning + building small tools that make my life easier

---

## 🔍 What I'm Into

I like building Python tools that solve problems I actually have.  
Sometimes that’s tracking my expenses, other times it's parsing Apple Health data or organizing stuff like shows or games.  

Most of my projects are pretty practical — I just build them when I need them.

Right now, I'm especially interested in:
- Applied Machine Learning
- Personal analytics & self-tracking
- Lightweight local-first tools
